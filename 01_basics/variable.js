const accountId = "1234443"

// changing the value of const variables are not allowed 
// using let is recommended than using the var becuase of issue in blockspace and functional space 
console.table([accountId,accountCity,accountState,accountPassword])
// using variables with let keyword is recommended instead of directly declaring them .
